# A simple game app

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Instructions

The game starts by pressing the roll dice button.
Once the game starts you accumulate the dice scores as current score but will only be added to your total score if and only if you press the 'Hold' button.
Press the 'Hold' button will also switch to the next player.

Beware the current score is refreshed if the dice roll is '1' and will switch to the next player.
So choose wisely when to hold and not get greedy.

You will still always have the option to restart the game by pressing the 'New Game' button.

### `The maximum score limit is 100`

Be the first to reach the score limit to win.
